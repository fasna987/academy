<!--					Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", <br>-->
				<!--					from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "creator") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, <br>-->
				<!--					and constructing buildings or any other structures</h5>-->
				<!--				<p>Building places to live, work, or learn in; designing spaces incorporating both aesthetic and cultural <br>-->
				<!--					reflection: Architecture is characterized by this challenging desire to serve everything while aspiring to improve our lifestyle-->
				<!--					A building always fits into an existing context and must carry meaning, which requires the broadest possible architectural reflection.-->
				<!--					When it comes to suggesting ways in which people can live together, to offer them opportunities for interaction and sharing, urban <br>-->
				<!--					planning, human and social sciences, and history of architecture all naturally take center stage, both in the architect’s training<br>-->
				<!--					and throughout his or her professional career.</p>-->
				<!--					<p>Volume modeling, studying the light, daring to try new materials, or designing a structure are all tasks in which the architect<br>-->
				<!--					must demonstrate great creativity. The challenges of sustainable development which, for example, means careful use of energy, space,<br>-->
				<!--						and soil, are today part and parcel of his or her approach.</p>-->

<!--						to manage the building work, not unlike the conductor of an orchestra, overseeing the execution of the work which<br>-->
<!--						must be completed within the framework of the set budget and fixed deadlines. The architect’s field of activity<br>-->
<!--						has greatly widened during the past few years, because now you can practice your skills in fields ranging from <br>-->
<!--						heritage management to the remediation of sites and property valuation.</p>-->
